## Struggle Problems - Lesson 5

# Practice Problem 10

Given the following data structure and without modifying the original array, use the map method to return a new array identical in structure to the original but where the value of each integer is incremented by 1.

[{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}]

# Practice Problem 13

Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same sub-arrays as the original but ordered logically by only taking into consideration the odd numbers they contain.

arr = [[1, 6, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9]]

The sorted array should look like this:

[[1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 6, 9]]

# Practice Problem 14

Given this data structure write some code to return an array containing the colors of the fruits and the sizes of the vegetables. The sizes should be uppercase and the colors should be capitalized.

hsh = {
  'grape' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'small'},
  'carrot' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'apple' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'medium'},
  'apricot' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'marrow' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['green'], size: 'large'},
}

The return value should look like this:

[["Red", "Green"], "MEDIUM", ["Red", "Green"], ["Orange"], "LARGE"]

# Practice Problem 15

Given this data structure write some code to return an array which contains only the hashes where all the integers are even.

arr = [{a: [1, 2, 3]}, {b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4]}, {e: [8], f: [6, 10]}]
